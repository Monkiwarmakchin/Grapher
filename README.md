# Grapher
A not so simple grapher. Made in python with the tkinter, math, numpy and matplotlib libraries.

The sintax of the y functions is a little strict, all the multiplication must have the '*' symbol for example; and wasn't docummented, so I don't really remember how many types of operations this can handle.
